check the css media query on 'Our History'.  the footer does something weird between 768px and 802 px
check volunteers page where Gerrys image runs over text (on work tablet in landscape)
css on the dropdown menu on mainNav
when screen size is small, the header is too small, and when screen size big header still needs work.
need to make boat image on /Home resizable
sidebar needs autofocus to scroll
need to sort Header and Header2 out (Header2 is the good one)
check icons on the nav bars

*** Make all headers and footer always visible?  ****

still side to side shift on our History

BUG, when you open in mobile and open menu, then change to screen, Menu remains :-/

when header is viewed on s7 in landscape mode, header is fuggered

check console messages when you click on About Us and Book Your Trip
            and why no render of current page???
